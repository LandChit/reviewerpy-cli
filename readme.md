# ReviwerPy-cli
It may be simple but it might be able to help you

### Recomendation for your text file
* Always use groups
* If you dont know where to group your question just make an "UNGROUPED" group it will help you a lot

## Incoming Features
* Grouping enumerated questions
* GUI(Not my priority since its a CLI)
* (your recomendation if its good ofc)
